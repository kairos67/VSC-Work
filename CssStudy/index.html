    <p>A roller coaster at a Jersey Shore amusement park is safe even though a pair of water-filled dummies plunged off
        the ride while it was tested earlier this month, an official for Playland’s Castaway Cove in Ocean City told a
        television station.
        The dummies had leaks that caused them to lose shape and mass before both fell from the GaleForce
        at Playland’s Castaway Cove in Ocean City, according to a report by NBCPhiladelphia.com.
        The dummies tumbled onto the roof of the Ebb Tide Suites next door, damaging the motel’s shingles
        and plywood during the April 20 accident. No one was hurt.
